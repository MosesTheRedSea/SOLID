## Spatial Object Learning with Integrated Dimensions 
Multi-Modal Object Classification (RGB + Depth + Geometry)

- Combine visual appearance with 3D shape information
- Novel fusion architectures for RGB-D classification
- Test on objects that look similar but have different 3D properties
- Simulate realistic depth sensors with noise/occlusions
- Compare early vs. late vs. intermediate fusion strategies
