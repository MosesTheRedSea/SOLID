### Proposal
- This project addresses the challenge of object classification in real-world 3D environments by leveraging complementary data modalities: RGB images, depth maps, and 3D geometry.
-  Traditional classification pipelines often rely on RGB data alone, which limits spatial understanding and robustness to occlusions and lighting variations. Our goal is to develop a multi-modal classification framework that fuses visual, depth, and geometric data into a unified, high-performing model.

### Introduction
- SOLID Vision represents a comprehensive approach to multi-modal object classification that integrates three key data modalities to achieve superior performance in complex 3D environments. By combining the strengths of RGB imagery, depth perception, and geometric understanding, our framework addresses the limitations of single-modality approaches and provides robust classification capabilities.

### Problem
Current object classification systems face several critical limitations:
- Limited Spatial Understanding: RGB-only models lack depth perception and 3D spatial awareness
- Vulnerability to Environmental Changes: Performance degrades under varying lighting conditions and occlusions
- Incomplete Feature Representation: Single modalities cannot capture the full complexity of real-world objects
- Robustness Issues: Traditional approaches struggle with partial views and challenging scenarios

### Motivation
Real-world applications demand classification systems that can:
- Operate reliably across diverse environmental conditions
- Leverage multiple complementary data sources for enhanced accuracy
- Provide robust performance in the presence of occlusions and lighting variations
- Enable advanced robotics and autonomous system applications
- Bridge the gap between 2D computer vision and 3D scene understanding

### Overview
- SOLID Vision implements a modular multi-modal architecture that processes three key data streams:

Data Modalities

- RGB Images: Capture color, texture, and fine-grained visual details using ResNet or Vision Transformers (ViT)
- Depth Maps: Provide spatial cues through normalized depth representations processed with CNN-based encoders
- 3D Geometry: Encoded as point clouds or voxel grids, processed via PointNet++ or volumetric CNNs

Fusion Strategies

- Early Fusion: Concatenation of raw modalities before feature extraction
- Late Fusion: Independent feature extraction followed by decision-level integration
- Cross-Attention Fusion: Transformer-based modules for learning shared representations across modalities

### Features

- Multi-Modal Integration: Seamlessly combines RGB, depth, and 3D geometric data
- Flexible Fusion Architectures: Support for early, late, and transformer-based fusion strategies
- Comprehensive Evaluation: Extensive benchmarking across multiple standard datasets
- Modular Design: Easy to extend and customize for specific applications
- PyTorch Implementation: Built on modern deep learning frameworks
- Robust Data Processing: Includes normalization, augmentation, and spatial alignment
- Visualization Tools: t-SNE plots, attention heatmaps, and prediction visualizations
