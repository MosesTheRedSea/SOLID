### Proposal
- This project addresses the challenge of object classification in real-world 3D environments by leveraging complementary data modalities: RGB images, depth maps, and 3D geometry. Traditional classification pipelines often rely on RGB data alone, which limits spatial understanding and robustness to occlusions and lighting variations. Our goal is to develop a multi-modal classification framework that fuses visual, depth, and geometric data into a unified, high-performing model.

### Introduction
- SOLID Vision represents a comprehensive approach to multi-modal object classification that integrates three key data modalities to achieve superior performance in complex 3D environments. By combining the strengths of RGB imagery, depth perception, and geometric understanding, our framework addresses the limitations of single-modality approaches and provides robust classification capabilities.
- 
### Problem
Current object classification systems face several critical limitations:
- Limited Spatial Understanding: RGB-only models lack depth perception and 3D spatial awareness
- Vulnerability to Environmental Changes: Performance degrades under varying lighting conditions and occlusions
- Incomplete Feature Representation: Single modalities cannot capture the full complexity of real-world objects
- Robustness Issues: Traditional approaches struggle with partial views and challenging scenarios
