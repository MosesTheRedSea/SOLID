## Proposal
This project tackles the challenge of object classification in real-world 3D environments by leveraging complementary data modalities: RGB images, depth maps, and 3D geometry. Traditional classification models relying solely on RGB data are inherently limited in spatial understanding and robustness. SOLID Vision aims to develop a fusion framework that unifies these modalities into a single, high-performing model.

## Introduction
SOLID Vision is a comprehensive approach to multi-modal object classification. It integrates three key data streams to overcome the limitations of single-modality systems. By combining RGB imagery, depth perception, and geometric understanding, our architecture achieves superior performance in complex 3D environments.

## Problem
Current object classification systems suffer from several key limitations:

- **Limited Spatial Understanding**: RGB-only models lack depth perception and 3D awareness.
- **Sensitivity to Environmental Conditions**: Performance degrades under varying lighting and occlusions.
- **Incomplete Feature Representation**: Single modalities cannot fully capture the complexity of real-world objects.
- **Robustness Issues**: Struggles with partial views and non-ideal scenarios.

## Motivation
Real-world applications demand robust classification systems that:

- Operate reliably across diverse environmental conditions
- Leverage complementary data sources for greater accuracy
- Maintain performance in the presence of occlusion or lighting variation
- Support robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems
- Bridge the gap between 2D computer vision and 3D spatial reasoning

## Overview

### Data Modalities

- **RGB Images**: Capture color, texture, and fine-grained visual details using CNN backbones like ResNet or Vision Transformers (ViT).
- **Depth Maps**: Provide spatial cues via normalized depth channels processed through CNN-based encoders.
- **3D Geometry**: Represented as point clouds or voxel grids, processed with PointNet++, volumetric CNNs, or graph-based models.

### Fusion Strategies

- **Early Fusion**: Combine raw input data before feature extraction.
- **Late Fusion**: Independently process each modality and integrate features later.
- **Cross-Attention Fusion**: Use transformer-based modules to learn shared multi-modal representations.

## Features

- Multi-Modal Integration: Fuses RGB, depth, and geometric data
- Flexible Fusion Architectures: Supports early, late, and attention-based strategies
- Modular Design: Easy to extend or adapt to new modalities or architectures
- Benchmark Evaluation: Compatible with datasets like [ModelNet40](https://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/), [SUN RGB-D](https://rgbd.cs.princeton.edu/), etc.
- Visualization Tools: Includes t-SNE plots, attention maps, and prediction visualizations
- Data Preprocessing: Normalization, augmentation, and spatial alignment routines included
- PyTorch-based Implementation: Fully open-source and customizable
